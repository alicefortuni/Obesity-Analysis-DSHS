# Exploratory analysis of the percentage of obesity in the world on WHO dataset

## Abstract
This document provides an in-depth analysis of global obesity rates data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), using statistical tools implemented in the R programming language. The primary objective is to explore differences in obesity rates between men and women, analyze variations across different global regions, and observe trends in these rates over time. The results highlight significant trends in the growth of obesity rates globally, with notable variations between regions and genders. These observations suggest the influence of global and regional factors, prompting future research to delve deeper into their causes.

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of global obesity trends using the dataset provided by the WHO. It includes:

- **Exploration of Obesity Rates**: Analyzing differences in obesity prevalence between men and women.
- **Regional Analysis**: Examining variations in obesity rates across different global regions.
- **Temporal Trends**: Observing how obesity rates have evolved over time.

## Data
The analysis utilizes obesity rate data sourced from the World Health Organization. 
The data used in this analysis can be found in the "data.csv" file.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
  - `dplyr`: For data manipulation and transformation.
  - `sf`: For handling spatial data.
  - `rnaturalearth`: For accessing natural earth map data.
  - `rnaturalearthdata`: For additional map data.
  - `lattice`: For creating trellis graphics.
  - `stringr`: For string manipulation.
  - `tidyr`: For tidying data.

## Conclusions
The analysis shows significant differences in obesity rates by gender, region, and time. These differences highlight the impact of socio-economic, cultural, and lifestyle factors. Further research integrating additional data is needed to develop targeted, evidence-based interventions for global obesity.
